a=(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,"a","b","c") #this is a tuple type of data

b=list(a) #casting to list

#casting: a process that converts a variable's data type into another data type.

b.append("d")
print(b)
print(a)
# you can not add or delete any data in the tuple. if u need to add data ,first u need to change(cast) the variable's data type. but it wont to add on tuple but adding in only list.
